# keylogger-project
Lightweight keylogger designed to record basic keyboard input, made with Python.
For educational purposes only.

When this keylogger is ran, it will most likely be flagged and quarantined by Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
## Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**Install the required libraries:**
```bash
# Install this in your terminal

pip install pynput
```

## Purpose
I wanted to further understand how keyloggers work, and what a threat actor would see from a simple keylogger like this one. This project provides code for those interested in understanding some perspective of threat actors and what they might see when running keyloggers.

## How it works
```bash
# Run the script in the folder's terminal

python3 keylogger.py
